A simple example of matrix use in OpenGL
========================================
This is the implementation of a rotating cube that rotates along its y axis.
Currently I am compilin on Mac OSX Yosemite so the makefile must be altered to compile on linux.


Building This Example
---------------------

*This example requires GLM*
*On ubuntu it can be installed with this command*

>$ sudo apt-get install libglm-dev

*On a Mac you can install GLM with this command(using homebrew)*
>$ brew install glm

To build this example just 

>$ cd build
>$ make

*If you are using a Mac you will need to edit the makefile in the build directory*

The excutable will be put in bin

Additional Notes For OSX Users
------------------------------

Ensure that the latest version of the Developer Tools is installed.
